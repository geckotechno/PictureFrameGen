The Picture Frame Generator takes a directory as the source and
generated image files in 800x640 (scaled proportionaly with black trim border)
and adds a second copy of the image with texted added if entries in 
file.properties match the file name.  This is assuming that your picture
frame reads files form the thumb drive in alphanumberic order like mine does.
